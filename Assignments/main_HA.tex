\section{Introduction}
BURN AFTER READING. 

I.e., everything that follows can be deleted up until the command 'printbibliography'.

\subsection{Minimal Working Example Citation}
A usual citation looks like this \parencite{R2016}. Whereas, a direct citation looks like this: \textcite{Hlavac2015} approves (hopefully). The bibliography is compiled automatically using the bib-file (in this case called 'bib\_file.bib'). To add additional sources add the bibtex code for the sources into the bib-file. More information about citation can be found in this \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management#biblatex}{Wikibook (click me)}, just make sure that you use biblatex and not bibtex (there is a difference!).\\

The code for the bib\_file can be also obtained from scholar.google.com, i.e., search for 'Modigliani Miller 1958' (\href{https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&q=modigliani+miller+1958&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=}{result of the search (click me)}) and then click on 'cite' and then 'BibTeX' (in this case biblatex and bibtex behave the same), which results in this 
\begin{verbatim}
@article{modigliani1958cost,
  title={The cost of capital, corporation finance and the theory of investment},
  author={Modigliani, Franco and Miller, Merton H},
  journal={The American economic review},
  volume={48},
  number={3},
  pages={261--297},
  year={1958},
  publisher={JSTOR}
}
\end{verbatim}

that can be directly copied to the bib\_file (though you might want to change the key from 'modigliani1958cost' to 'Modigliani1958' or something like this, just make sure that you refer to the right key!).\\

To compile the document with the citations you need to compile it using 'PdfLaTeX - BibTex(biber) - (2x) PdfLaTeX' (or you can change that in the 'quick-build' option in the Options). Make sure that you have biber installed and working. If it's not working check these options out (using Texmaker):
Go to 'Options' $\rightarrow$ 'Configure Texmaker' $\rightarrow$ 'Commands' $\rightarrow$ edit the field 'Bib(la)tex' to:
\begin{itemize}
\item MAC: biber \%.bcf \\
If not working check this \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/153359/setting-up-texmaker-on-mac-to-work-with-biber}{SO-question (click me)}
\item Win: "C:/Program Files (x86)/MiKTeX 2.9/miktex/bin/biber.exe" \%\\
Or wherever your miktex is installed. If this is not working check this \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/63039/install-biber-in-miktex-on-a-64-bit-version-of-windows}{SO-question (click me)})
\end{itemize}

For the sake of completeness I also cite a book by \textcite{Wilkinson2006}, an article by two \textcite{Modigliani1958}, as well as another article by three \textcite{Johnson2000}. Last tip, if it shows up like this \textcite{UnknownKey2000}, that means the key for the citation is not found!

\subsection{Minimal Working Example Pictures}
Pictures look like this (caption above, description below, centered image, relative size to text may vary depending on your needs). If you have questions refer to \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions}{this Wikibook (click me)}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pictures/beach.jpg} \\
\caption{Image captions go below the image (usually)}
\small Some more information if necessary.
\end{figure}


\subsection{Minimal Working Example Math}
\label{subsec:math}
A math equation is centered and numbered which looks like this:

\begin{equation}
a = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2}.
\end{equation}

If possible align equations (if you use multiple equations per equation-float):

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
a &= \sqrt{b^2 + c^2}\\
b &= \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} + 100 - 100 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

There is the possibility of having inline-math which looks like this $\lambda = 1 - x$, but refrain from abusing it to look like this: $\mu = \displaystyle \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{x}{n}$ (inline).

For more information regarding math in \LaTeX, please refer to \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics}{this Wikibook (click me)}

\subsection{Minimal Working Example Tables}
Tables should be saved in a separate file to keep the source-file (i.e., the document that you compile) tidy.\\

A table looks like \autoref{tab:Table1} (keep in mind that \LaTeX \ decides for you where to put the table, you can specify parameters such as '[h!]' ('h' for here, 'b' for bottom of the page, 't' for top, and 'p' for appendix. An '!' adds weight to a single parameter; you can also chain commands such as '[htbp]'. Because of pushing-around, make sure that you use references as described in \autoref{subsec:references}). \\

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{Table captions go above the table (usually)}
\label{tab:Table1}
\input{tables/reg_table.tex}\\
\bigskip
\small Additional Information can be supplied here in the form of free text! If you want to have the same width as the table, include a row in the table itself!
\end{table}

Regression results should be exported automatically, i.e., using the r-packages stargazer, texreg, xtable or some other alternative. The code to produce the table shown, is in the appendix in \autoref{sec:appendix}. \\

For more information regarding tables in \LaTeX, please refer to \href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables}{this Wikibook (click me)}. If you have a long table, use the longtable latex-package!
\newpage

\subsection{Referencing Examples}
\label{subsec:references}
If possible, use the power of \LaTeX \ to automatically reference. I.e., to refer to \autoref{subsec:math} (the Maths subsection) or to \autoref{tab:Table1} (in Texmaker you see red boxes around the links, these disappear in the PDF-print, if you want to disable them at all, include the '[hidelinks]' parameter to the usepackage-hyperref-command in the preamble in line 16).
